/*
678. Valid Parenthesis String
Medium

Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.
Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.
'*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
An empty string is also valid.

Intuition

When checking whether the string is valid, we only cared about the "balance": the number of extra, open left brackets as we parsed through the string. For example, when checking whether '(()())' is valid, we had a balance of 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0 as we parse through the string: '(' has 1 left bracket, '((' has 2, '(()' has 1, and so on. This means that after parsing the first i symbols, (which may include asterisks,) we only need to keep track of what the balance could be.

For example, if we have string '(***)', then as we parse each symbol, the set of possible values for the balance is [1] for '('; [0, 1, 2] for '(*'; [0, 1, 2, 3] for '(**'; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] for '(***', and [0, 1, 2, 3] for '(***)'.

Furthermore, we can prove these states always form a contiguous interval. Thus, we only need to know the left and right bounds of this interval. That is, we would keep those intermediate states described above as [lo, hi] = [1, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 3].

Algorithm

Let lo, hi respectively be the smallest and largest possible number of open left brackets after processing the current character in the string.

If we encounter a left bracket (c == '('), then lo++, otherwise we could write a right bracket, so lo--. If we encounter what can be a left bracket (c != ')'), then hi++, otherwise we must write a right bracket, so hi--. If hi < 0, then the current prefix can't be made valid no matter what our choices are. Also, we can never have less than 0 open left brackets. At the end, we should check that we can have exactly 0 open left brackets.
